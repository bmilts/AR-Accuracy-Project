# AR-Accuracy-Project
University dissertation project to test how augmented reality effects the accuracy of object recognition using machine learning.

## Description
Using Swift, tensorflow, CoreML and ARKit to build a machine learning based augmented reality testing application. Recognizing objects from both a photo and augmented reality, the app allows for a results comparison for analysis.

## Features

* Apply a pre-trained machine learning model using coreml to photographs
* Apply the same pre-trained model to a live feed using the vision framework 
* Place Augmented Labels of the model prediction result using ARKit
